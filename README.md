# MIDIShifter Branch of:
# MagicShifter3000

##### /Firmware
The Firmware running on the MagicShifter3000.

#### /MIDI 
MIDI is the Musical Instrument Digital Interface.  In essence, it is a decent networking protocol for the UART's of the MagicShifter3000, in that it plugs the light-synth into other-synths.

#### /Light-based interaction with Music-making
Putting the MagichShifter3000 interface to use in a musical context means that we can have any synthesizer being used to make music with naught but a light show.

#### /Sequencer
Sequencing MIDI events is worthy of the remaining RAM of the MagicShifter3000, in that it really gets the party started.  MIDI events in process.

##### /JsApi
A notdoneyet prototype of a javascript client/server api to contact the magicshifter from wherever javascript runs

##### /React	
A reactjs isomorphic app which will be served both from local.magicshifter.net and from magicshifter.local

##### /Web
A riotjs test app, switched to react so this is a dead tree and should be removed sometime soonish (see below).

##### /Web_Old
Some static html files which do a lot of useful development stuff,
should actually be moved (back) to Web soonish.
